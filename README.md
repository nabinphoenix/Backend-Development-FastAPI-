# Backend-Development-FastAPI-
This repository contains my intern assessment project for Arcodify Agency. It features a RESTful API built with FastAPI for user registration, JWT authentication, and to-do list management. It includes admin controls, CRUD for todos, background email tasks, PostgreSQL integration, Swagger docs, and Docker/local setup.
